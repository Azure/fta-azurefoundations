# FastTrack for Azure - CaaS Infrastructure Credentialing  
The credentialing process for FastTrack Engineers looking to pursue the CaaS infrastructure credential will be semi-modeled after the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation's](https://www.cncf.io/) [Certified Kubernetes Administrator's](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/) exam, with the omission of topics surrounding bootrapping of Kubernetes clusters. Additional topics and focus on the Azure platform and Azure container services such as AKS, ACR, and ACI will be added. 

You can view the curriculum for the CKA exam [here](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum).

> ** PLEASE NOTE:** 

## Credentialing Process
Similar to the CKA exam, the credentialing process for CaaS Infrastructure will be partially performance based. This means the facilitator will ask questions to the engineer on how to accomplis a task and the engineer will actively work through the task either through the portal, CLI, or both. Due to the fact that this credentialing process is partially performance based, this means that the credentialing appointment will need both participants available to attend a screen share.
