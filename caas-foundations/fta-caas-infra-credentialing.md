# FastTrack for Azure - CaaS Infrastructure Credentialing  
The credentialing process for FastTrack Engineers looking to pursue the CaaS infrastructure credential will be semi-modeled after the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation's](https://www.cncf.io/) [Certified Kubernetes Administrator's](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/) exam, with the omission of topics surrounding bootrapping of Kubernetes clusters. Additional topics and focus on the Azure platform and Azure container services such as AKS, ACR, and ACI will be added.
