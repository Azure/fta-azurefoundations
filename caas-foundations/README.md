# CaaS Foundations 
[Containers as a service (CaaS)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32444/containers-as-a-service-caas) is a cloud service model that allows users to manage and deploy containers, applications and clusters through container-based virtualization. CaaS is highly useful to IT departments and developers in building secure and scalable containerized applications. With CaaS, this can be achieved using on-premises data centers or over the cloud.
